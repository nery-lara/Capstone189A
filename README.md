When a potential customer calls a business, the last thing they want is to be placed on hold. Everyone has had this experience and knows that it usually results in wasted time or hanging up before the hold is over. For the business this results in lost clients and a bad customer experience if people are left on hold for too long. This project aims to solve this terrible on-hold experience by providing a quick and easy way to have the business call the potential customer when they are ready and would eliminate this issue altogether. Our solution will eliminate the on-hold experience completely, which means customers could choose to hang up if they donâ€™t want to wait for a response and let the business call them back. We will setup a hosted service where a customer can call, hear a prompt, and hang up. We will also provide service to ask for a phone number to call. More specifically, we will use a cloud platform to deploy our application. We will be using Twilio or Freeswitch to help us connect the calls for business and customers.
