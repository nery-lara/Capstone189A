When a potential customer calls a business, the last thing they want is to be placed on hold. Everyone has had this experience and knows that it usually results in wasted time or hanging up before the hold is over. For the business this results in lost clients and a bad customer experience if people are left on hold for too long. This project aims to solve this terrible on-hold experience by providing a quick and easy way to have the business call the potential customer when they are ready and would eliminate this issue altogether. Our solution will eliminate the on-hold experience completely, which means customers could choose to hang up if they don’t want to wait for a response and let the business call them back. We will setup a hosted service where a customer can call, hear a prompt, and hang up. We will also provide service to ask for a phone number to call. More specifically, we will use a cloud platform to deploy our application. We will be using Twilio or Freeswitch to help us connect the calls for business and customers.

Project Specifics:
Team goals/objectives
The project provides customers with a solution that enables them to hang up immediately if they would not like to wait for a long time. This eliminates the problem of frustrated customers due to long waits and reduces business losses due to callers hanging up and not calling back. Our goal is to minimize the customers’ anger in this situation and help the businesses get back to them as soon as possible. For the customers who would like to wait, our stretch goal is to process their voice signal, detect what they like and provide them different ads and music based on the voice processing while they are waiting. 
Background
Most businesses still make people wait on hold if they are not able to answer the customers immediately. Some businesses place their customers on hold to complete silence or use the ubiquitous “your call is important to us” message.
Customers are extremely unsatisfied by the long long waiting time.
Assumptions
Most customers do not want the on hold experience for wasting their time.
Customers prefer business to call them back when they are available.
Businesses do not want to take time to check customers’ numbers and call back
Business would lose their customers if they put their customers on hold.
